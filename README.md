# allegheny-building-import
Some files that are useful for the Allegheny County building import.

# allegheny-county-buildings.osm.zip
The OSM file containing all of the data I plan on importing. Be careful, it's very large.

# pittsburgh.py
The Python file that I used with ogr2osm to convert the shapefile.

# Data Samples
I decided to make three different samples from this dataset: one primarily urban, one suburban, and one rural.

# sample-bellevue.osm
A sample of data from the import covering Bellevue, PA, a densely populated town near Pittsburgh. I chose this area because it's already exensively mapped in OSM, which makes it a little easier to evaluate the data quality.

# sample-castle-shannon.osm
A sample of data from Castle Shannon, a suburban area with a mix of houses and commerical buildings.

# sample-bakerstown.som
A sample from Bakerstown. Most of this sample covers a sparsely populated (for Allegheny County) area with relatively few houses.
